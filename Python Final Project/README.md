## Final Project For ITEC 3001 at Southwest Tech, Cedar City, Utah 84720.

## Synopsis
My goal was to create a simple word search game using a Graphical User Interface.

## Motivation
The Python class introduced classes and Graphical User Interfaces in the closing chapters.  Given a project time frame of 15 hours, I felt it would demonstrate my comprehension of the material as well as being challenging.

## How to Run
All the code needed to run this project is in the wordsearch.py file.
