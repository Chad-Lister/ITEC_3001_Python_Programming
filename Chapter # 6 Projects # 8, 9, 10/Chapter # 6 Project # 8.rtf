\f0\fs24 \cf0 Yes the function works.  The range is incremented  by one every time through.  It takes sequence at index 1 to last, essentially cutting off the first character at index 0.  The hidden cost to this function is that if the sequence contains more than one character, say \'9310\'94, it will print \'931\'94 then iterate again and print \'940\'94.  So it only works for single characters in a sequence.}
